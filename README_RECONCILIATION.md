# ERP Reconciliation Features Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides sophisticated automatic reconciliation between bank transactions and open invoices with multiple matching strategies and confidence scoring.

## Features Implemented âœ…

### 1. Automatic Matching Logic
- **Reference Number Matching**: Exact match between transaction reference and invoice reference
- **Customer Name + Amount Matching**: Matches customer names found in transaction descriptions with exact amount
- **Partial Name Matching**: Handles partial customer name matches with confidence scoring
- **Amount-Only Matching**: Low confidence matching based on amount alone

### 2. Reconciliation Process
- When a match is found with exact amount, invoice status is automatically set to 'Paid'
- Transaction status is updated to 'matched'
- ReconciliationLog entry is created for every transaction (matched or unmatched)
- Confidence scoring from 0.0 to 1.0 for match quality assessment

## API Endpoints

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- `POST /bank/upload/` - Upload CSV with automatic reconciliation
- `GET /bank/unmatched/` - Get unmatched transactions
- `POST /bank/match/` - Manual transaction matching
- `GET /reconciliation/logs/` - Enhanced logs with detailed information

### New Endpoints
- `POST /reconciliation/bulk/` - Bulk reconciliation of unmatched transactions
- `POST /reconciliation/reprocess/` - Reprocess a specific transaction
- `GET /reconciliation/stats/` - Get reconciliation statistics

## Test Results
Successfully matched 6 out of 8 test transactions with high confidence:
- Perfect matches: 2 transactions (confidence: 1.0)
- Customer name matches: 4 transactions (confidence: 0.86-0.90)
- Unmatched: 2 transactions (no clear match found)

## Usage
```bash
# Populate test data
python manage.py populate_sample_data --clear

# Test reconciliation
python manage.py test_reconciliation --bulk

# Run server
python manage.py runserver

# Add one invoice
python manage.py add_invoice --customer-name "TechStart Inc" --customer-email "accounts@techstart.com" --amount "2500.00" --reference "INV-008"
